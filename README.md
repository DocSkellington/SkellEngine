# SkellEngine, a game engine in C++

This project, now abandonned, in a game engine written in C++ over the [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) library. Many features are missing, and there is no guarantee that it works. It was, however, fun to work on this project over a few years (with many breaks).

The code is in the alpha branch.
