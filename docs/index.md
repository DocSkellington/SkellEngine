# About the Logger
Please, note that the logger is only enabled in debug build. The logger can write in the console or in the `media/log.txt` file or both depending on the configuration.


If you find any bugs (please consider grammar mistakes as bugs) or if you would like to propose a feature, please open an issue on [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/DocSkellington/Engine/issues).
