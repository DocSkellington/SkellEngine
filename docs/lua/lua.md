Lua reference {#lua}

[TOC]

You can look at the modules pages to get all the implemented Lua functions. The documentation is generated with doxygen-lua but the lua file (`documentation.lua`) used for it is a file created only for documentation purpose. The implementation in `documentation.lua` is not accurate at all as the functions are (almost) bound to a C++ function.
